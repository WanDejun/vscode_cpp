Good morning Ladies and Gentelmen. It's my Great honour to be here and give my presentation. Today my topic is about the impact of information gap. In this talk, I will discuss three aspects:
1. the prevalence of information gap,
2. its impact on individual and group development,
3. and how to break down information barriers.

First, as we all known unequal information exists all around us universally. With the development of information technology, people have more and more diversified ways to get information. However, some people keep up with the development of The time, while some people are left behind. Especially in the recent 20 years, information is exploding exponentially. Nobody can grasp all this knowledge, but to know how to get the infomation you need was very inportant. Zhang Xuefeng, a Education Consultant, become widely known in this year. But why? Because most of student and parents didn't get the information about how to choose majority and industry, and they aslo don't not which employment information. From this example, we can see that there is still a long way to go to narrow the information gap.


Second, let us explore the impact of poor information on individual and group development. Change alway wait for those who are prepared. Some people have more information resources, while others face the lack of information which will leads to an unequal distribution of knowledge and opportunity. Without a lot of chance it's very hard for the peason coupled with the team to get improvement. For ourselves, University undergraduate students, we can find a same point from those remarkable  senior schoolmates, they participated in many competitions and won a lot of won many awards. However most of the games you haven't even heard of, let alone attended. So it's aslo very inportant to get more information in Study and scientific research life time.


So how do we break down information barriers? First, develop the information consciousness is the key to breaking down information barriers. Make a conscious effort to develop sensitivity to information and pay attention to how information is obtained. You don't need to know the detail of the information but you have to know in which book or which website can you find the information. So that one day, if you need the detail, you can get it in short time. What's more we need to take advantage of the resources around you including our teacher, our senior schoolmates and anyone that maybe own the information you need. Fell free to ask them, you will receive a lot.


To sum up, poor information is common in real life, and it has a negative impact on individual and group development. However, through cultivate information awareness, we can narrpow down information barriers and narrow the information gap.



Thank you very much.
